# Personal Profile Page

A personal profile webpage to practice basic HTML and CSS skills from the treehouse FEWD techdegree. I customized the page with my own photos and information. I also had to use CSS to change colors, add animations, and improve the look of the page.

I had to further expand on the project for the highest grading by creating an additional page to expand on this online profile, edit the styling of the profile photo's CSS properties like transition and transform, add more photos and imagery to the page, and add more text to the page like a list of my hobbies.
