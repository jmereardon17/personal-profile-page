        <h2>My path to Web Development</h2>
        <img src="images/stavanger-city-centre.jpg" alt="Picture of Stavanger City Centre" class="about-photo">
        <p>When I was 13 years old my Step Father had given me my first computer. Back then I got heavily into computer gaming and enjoyed spending time on the computer, the internet, and socializing with people all over the world. With my huge interest in computing, I created a new hobby in building computers over the years which I thoroughly enjoyed. Through that time, I learned how to tweak, modify, and optimize computers for performance and stability. Since previously being a hardcore gamer, I enjoyed benchmarking computer hardware. With all this experience, I also learned to troubleshoot and resolve the many problems that computer devices encounter.</p>
        <p>With spending a lot of time using a computer, I started to gain an interest in web development. I was very intrigued by how a website was built. From then on, I started to self teach myself how to code websites.</p>
        <p>After having basic understanding concepts on how to code a webpage, I started to build websites for gaming communities/organisations. Although I enjoyed it, I felt like I hit a wall. Even with some of the youtube content that was available prior at the current time, I still couldn't quite grasp the concepts on my own.</p>
        <p>This is where <strong>Treehouse</strong> came in. After stopping and starting on learning, I found Treehouse in 2018. I was amazed at how well established and constructed the online school is.</p>
        <p>Now I am a current progressing techdegree student with high hopes of achieving my goals through the <em>Front End Web Development</em> programme.</p>
        <p>If you would like to see how I am getting on with my current progress, you can click <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/jamiereardon" target="_blank">here</a> to find out more.</p>
